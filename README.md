# MovieBud

### This app is meant to help users find a movie to watch when they are stuck.

#### This app was created using React and interacts with The Movie DB (TMDB) API. Users can select genres to filter out a movie if they choose, once they generate, a movie is displayed along with its poster, overview, release dates, genres, and ratings. Users can also go back to edit the filters or generate another movie using the same filters.
